Go ingame and enter the dungeon you want to make and type .GPS ( you need the MAP ID ).
The Exp of the Query was made for the Nexus.
Better to use Notepad++ to make your changes default = Orange Colors can be changed.
Make sure you make custom ItemLevel for your items if you want them to be looted as mine is 4000.
